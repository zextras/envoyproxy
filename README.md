# Envoy Proxy packages repo

This is an unusual package

## Bin instead of sources

After previous attempts on Envoy source compiling, this is the most efficient way to internally use envoy power.

Envoy buildin process is so tedious and power consuming. You have been warned

Here we use the official binaries (have a look at PKGBUILD `sources` field)
